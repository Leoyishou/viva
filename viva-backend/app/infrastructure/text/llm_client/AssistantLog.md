下面是我们的对话,你需要逐一对每一轮都提出建议和标记，尽量用掉你所有的 token：speaker B: Hello.
speaker A: Hey. Hi, Leo. Can you see me?
speaker B: Right. Is this the first time we talking in the morning?
speaker A: Me?
speaker B: We?
speaker A: Oh, us. Oh, really? I didn't think about that. Did you just wake up?
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: Why did you decide to start doing lessons in the morning.
speaker B: Before every day? We woke up at 10:00 a.m. This year I want to make it early, so I think schedule a lesson is a good way to make me wake up earlier.
speaker A: Okay. So usually you wake up at 10:00 a.m. You can have a Coca Cola at 09:00 a.m.?
speaker B: Right?
speaker A: Is that Coca Cola?
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: At 09:00 a.m. I never saw that before. I never saw anyone drink soda with breakfast. Shocked. Do you feel like a lot of people drink Coca Cola in, in China? Is it really popular?
speaker B: Yeah, my team leader. Really?
speaker A: Your team leader? Oh, so interesting. Okay. Oh, that's crazy. But what about coffee? You don't want coffee in the morning?
speaker B: I don't because I have happy to have a nap at noon. Maybe it will influence it.
speaker A: So you have a nap and then after your nap you will have coffee.
speaker B: Right.
speaker A: Interesting. Okay, I got it. What about like tea? You don't have any tea to help you wake up. Oh, I cannot see you.
speaker B: Hello?
speaker A: I cannot see you.
speaker B: Can you know.
speaker A: Let me refresh. What about now? I think it's good. I can see you clearly now. Oh, no, you cannot hear me. Can you hear me? Right, okay, so you said you usually wake up at 10:00 a.m. But I want to know if you start waking up earlier, like at 830 or nine, then will you start going to sleep earlier?
speaker B: Yeah, that's what I want to have. What time? 02:00 a.m. After. I know what you want to know.
speaker A: 02:00 a.m. But now what time will you start going to sleep?
speaker B: Midnight.
speaker A: Eight or nine.
speaker B: Midnight.
speaker A: Midnight. Midnight. Okay. When you say midnight, when you say mid, it sounds like you say need. So just try to make a short. I.
speaker B: Yeah, I know these things. Mid the night.
speaker A: Okay.
speaker B: Mid and I.
speaker A: Okay, I understand. So like 8 hours of sleep or eight and a half hours of sleep. It's good, right? It's good. I feel like a lot of people have the problem for not getting enough sleep. I know a lot of people who only sleep 6 hours a night, but I just feel like I could not function if I did that. Are you the type of person that can get like 6 hours or 5 hours of sleep and still feel good?
speaker B: Yeah. All right. I think I am really?
speaker A: Okay. But it sounds like you still get more than 8 hours of sleep a night.
speaker B: No more than.
speaker A: Okay around 8 hours of sleep a night right? Yeah but in the past you had less sleep.
speaker B: College 02:00 a.m. To 10:00 a.m. 8 hours it's still 8 hours but almost after 02:00 a.m..
speaker A: Okay but when you stay awake until 02:00 a.m. Is it because you go out or you're at home staying awake until 02:00 a.m. At a home?
speaker B: Play the phone.
speaker A: Just like using your phone? Yeah we don't usually say like play on our phone unless you can say like playing a game on my phone but we would just say like using my phone or sometimes we say something like scrolling. Scrolling means for example if I'm on. Yeah okay. Like social media and I just scroll scroll scroll scroll. This is scrolling and your page is like you could just do this for like an hour and you don't even know. Right? Yeah. Okay I got you. Nice. Okay so we're going to be doing morning lessons now. Good for you. It sounds difficult though. I started doing morning classes at like 08:00 a.m. Which I think for other people 08:00 a.m. Does not sound early but for me that means I have to wake up at 730 so it's really early for me. I don't like waking up so early.
speaker B: Yeah what's the first thing after you wake up?
speaker A: Like what do I do? My morning routine.
speaker B: What team? Pardon?
speaker A: Morning routine?
speaker B: Yeah what's her morning routine?
speaker A: I usually get up and make my bed and then I drink warm water. One sway and then I get dressed and I don't do anything else. I check all my messages because when I'm sleeping it's the daytime in the US so usually when I wake up I have a lot of messages because it's people's daytime so then I will spend the time to respond to everything and then I just start teaching. So I already taught for like 1 hour. Yeah just finished 1 hour. Yeah but I'm not really a morning person like naturally I think maybe also not you.
speaker B: Yeah when I went to work I just sit here pretend I'm working with further lunch.
speaker A: Okay so afternoon you're more productive.
speaker B: All right.
speaker A: But I am definitely the type of person who likes to eat breakfast. Many times I can skip lunch or skip dinner but I don't like to skip breakfast because I feel much better if I eat breakfast.
speaker B: Okay I never eat breakfast.
speaker A: Oh you never eat breakfast? Just Coca Cola?
speaker B: No, it's not the routine.
speaker A: Okay.
speaker B: I just want to drink something. So I find a coca Cola in the refrigerator.
speaker A: Sorry, it's just crazy to me. I could never drink that. Okay, so you never eat breakfast, right. Really? My sister is like that too, because.
speaker B: In the college I got up later even more, maybe 11:00 so it's not sort of time to eat breakfast.
speaker A: But would you still eat when you woke up?
speaker B: I just eat lunch.
speaker A: Yeah, but that's still like 1 hour after you wake up, so it's technically like your morning.
speaker B: Yeah, but I maybe wash something. Okay. When I went to dining hall, it's.
speaker A: I'm curious. I kind of know what the common breakfast is to have in Taiwan. But what are the common breakfast for people in, like, what do people usually.
speaker B: Have for breakfast in Beijing? In all the area of north China? The bald.
speaker A: Yotiao.
speaker B: Bald. And milk. Do you know dofano?
speaker A: Dofino.
speaker B: Made of beans, but it's like dozen.
speaker A: Okay. I don't know it. Dofa.
speaker B: No, tofu. Translation is.
speaker A: Oh, you call it this. You don't call it dohua?
speaker B: Yeah. In the north we call it.
speaker A: Oh, cool. I didn't know that. Okay, nice. Cool. This is really nice because actually a lot of places I go, they don't have the savory dohua. Usually people eat the sweet dohua here, but that looks really good. And then it's like protein in the morning.
speaker B: Yeah, protein enriched protein.
speaker A: But what do people put on top of doha? The tofu. For the breakfast, what is usually goes on top?
speaker B: A kind of sauce can make it salty.
speaker A: Salty?
speaker B: Yeah. Otherwise it's like water.
speaker A: Right. It's kind of like soy sauce. The sauce. Or like chili oil.
speaker B: Chili oil, how to spell it?
speaker A: Yeah. Like chili oil. No, sorry, chili oil. Like this. Ah, the Sauce you talk about is from like meat, Ryan. Totally. Okay. Yeah, it has a lot of flavor. It's very salty. Okay, interesting. You know, a lot of people here, they just go out for breakfast, but actually, I think since food is expensive in the US, we cook a lot of our meals, so we'll make something fast at home. But I noticed most people here, they don't make breakfast. They'll go out and get something fast.
speaker B: Yeah. Some of my colleagues would do it by themselves in the morning. So fast. Breakfast.
speaker A: Do people eat like, manto?
speaker B: Manto is more common at noon. At lunch.
speaker A: At lunch it's just bread. Okay, that's so funny. Okay. Are a lot of people concerned, like, in the US, we have a lot of different diet trends that people do. Are people in China very concerned with doing diets or. No.
speaker B: What's the meaning of concerned? Diets pay more than.
speaker A: No, what I mean is, I don't just mean, like, what they eat. I mean, like making a diet. Like, do people have diet plans in China? Often?
speaker B: Not common.
speaker A: Yeah, it's not common. Okay. Yeah.
speaker B: Because most people, I think most people don't have basic knowledge about nutrition. Actually, their knowledge about food is from the traditional medicine, I think. But they're not scientific.
speaker A: Yeah, I know you don't like the chinese medicine. Okay. But I'm mostly wondering, because in the US, we have diet plans that are more like, we have one called Atkins diet, or there's types of diets where people count calories, which is really old. People don't do this so much now, but there's also one recently. This is the one I want to talk to you about. Recently, some Americans have been doing a carnivore diet. Have you heard about this.
speaker B: Carnival?
speaker A: No. We are all omnivores.
speaker B: They don't eat the foods from plants. Not at all.
speaker A: Not at all, bro. It's so weird.
speaker B: I don't know why. Because if you want to distinguish the food from plants, it's also difficult, isn't it?
speaker A: No, because no pasta, no rice, no vegetables. They eat, like, beef and fish and butter. Butter. And they eat nothing else. Maybe eggs. Eggs. Eggs.
speaker B: Why do they go like this?
speaker A: Because I'm telling you, this is a trend. Like a fad, right? People believe, they did a lot of research on diets, on healthy diets, and they believe that a very high protein and fat diet, and no carbs, no sugars, like these types of things. It's like an extreme diet. We would call this an extreme diet, but my aunt and my uncle have been doing this diet for a year, which means they have eaten nothing but meat and eggs and butter for a year.
speaker B: How does it affect.
speaker A: So, a lot of the time, the reason people do these diets is because they want to have the high muscle mass.
speaker B: Right?
speaker A: High muscle mass and low fat. They don't want to have a lot of fat. So my auntie and my uncle, they lost a lot of weight. Yeah, a lot. They lost a lot of weight. But it's really weird because they kind of ignore the things that are not good that are happening. Like, for example, they cannot poop very well. And they're just like. It's because our body is adjusting or because we don't have a lot of vegetables.
speaker B: He cannot poop poop, poop.
speaker A: Go to the bathroom. Poop. Poop. Not pee. Poop. Go it.
speaker B: Okay, I got.
speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, Dabian. They cannot poop because their digestive system is not good now anyway. Okay, so I was wondering, China doesn't have any weird diets or something that people try.
speaker B: The people in the room pay more attention on it.
speaker A: Who?
speaker B: Fitness in Jane.
speaker A: Fitness. Fitness.
speaker B: Fitness. Yeah.
speaker A: Like people who train at the. Okay, sure.
speaker B: Could this kind of exercise totally were from foreign countries. So all the theory are modern. So they focus on the diet. Actually.
speaker A: All of what is modern?
speaker B: The workout.
speaker A: The workout plan is like a modern workout plan. I never heard anyone say that.
speaker B: This kind of sport you work out from abroad.
speaker A: Crossfit.
speaker B: I search it.
speaker A: It's like crossfit. Okay, I think I know what you're talking about. Or maybe not. Or is it bodybuilding?
speaker B: Yeah. Even the bar. What's the bar? Bell bar and stick bar? Yeah. All of them are abroad.
speaker A: You mean imported from abroad?
speaker B: Yeah, imported.
speaker A: Okay, so you're just saying that they do, like, foreign style exercise plans.
speaker B: Diet plan and.
speaker A: Diet plan.
speaker B: Yeah. Okay. This kind of sport was imported. So the people getting involved in are not influenced by the traditional medicine. So they have the same modern diet theory.
speaker A: Okay, I understand what you're saying. They don't subscribe to the traditional way of thinking. Okay.
speaker B: Yeah. And there is also a slogan that 30 percentage exercise and 70% age 18.
speaker A: 70% age 1818.
speaker B: Right. 70%.
speaker A: Okay, I see what you're saying. Yeah. Do a lot of people do, like, protein shakes for that? Okay, I know that you work out sometimes. Do you do anything for your diet or do you just eat whatever you want and then exercise?
speaker B: Coach, make a priority of gona diet about control the calorie, about your calories. Yeah. So I lost weight so fast, but someday he went to his hometown to get married, so there's nobody regulating me. So I went back again.
speaker A: Wait, how long has he been gone?
speaker B: Three months.
speaker A: He's not coming back, right?
speaker B: Not in Beijing.
speaker A: You need a new trainer. We usually call this a trainer, not a coach.
speaker B: I found a trainer last night.
speaker A: You did? Nice.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: Okay, cool. At the same gym?
speaker B: No, a new gym. A new gym around my.
speaker A: Nice. So usually we'll say trainer for someone who's helping you go to the gym and train your body. Coach is more for like, for example, if you do like, a b side, if you're doing a competition, then you will have a coach to teach you how to prepare for that.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: Just a little bit different. Yeah. Okay, so for your workouts, do you mostly do weightlifting or do you also do cardio weightlifting? Okay. Do you do stretching? Do you stretch? Oh, sorry. Go ahead.
speaker B: Yeah. After the weight lifting, maybe ten minute stretch is important.
speaker A: Okay. Wait, you stretch for 10 minutes? Oh, that's so good. My boyfriend will never stretch with me. I always tell him, you should stretch, and he skip it. He's like, I'm too lazy because I feel like men usually skip stretching and the women always stretch. You know what I mean? But it's important.
speaker B: It night. Patient. Patient. Women are more.
speaker A: Yeah, when you say, don't say woman, you say women.
speaker B: Oh, yeah, women.
speaker A: Okay. You do weightlifting. So do you usually do. I just want to go through some gym words with you that maybe you don't know. So are you doing endurance lifts like, you try to see how long you can go, or do you do power lifts? Do you know the difference?
speaker B: I. Power lift. Emphasize the maximum weight that you can lift.
speaker A: Yeah. Power lifts is the maximum weight you can do. And then maybe you just do a few of them, like maybe one, two, three.
speaker B: I think I prefer which one? Endurance. Yeah, endurance.
speaker A: Yeah. I think it's better for you anyway because you're not preparing for, like, a competition or something. Same. Okay. Sorry. The time is running out. Have a good day. Bye.`

下面是我们的对话,你需要逐一对每一轮都提出建议和标记，尽量用掉你所有的 token：speaker B: Hello.
speaker A: Hey. Hi, Leo. Can you see me?
speaker B: Right. Is this the first time we talking in the morning?
speaker A: Me?
speaker B: We?
speaker A: Oh, us. Oh, really? I didn't think about that. Did you just wake up?
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: Why did you decide to start doing lessons in the morning.
speaker B: Before every day? We woke up at 10:00 a.m. This year I want to make it early, so I think schedule a lesson is a good way to make me wake up earlier.
speaker A: Okay. So usually you wake up at 10:00 a.m. You can have a Coca Cola at 09:00 a.m.?
speaker B: Right?
speaker A: Is that Coca Cola?
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: At 09:00 a.m. I never saw that before. I never saw anyone drink soda with breakfast. Shocked. Do you feel like a lot of people drink Coca Cola in, in China? Is it really popular?
speaker B: Yeah, my team leader. Really?
speaker A: Your team leader? Oh, so interesting. Okay. Oh, that's crazy. But what about coffee? You don't want coffee in the morning?
speaker B: I don't because I have happy to have a nap at noon. Maybe it will influence it.
speaker A: So you have a nap and then after your nap you will have coffee.
speaker B: Right.
speaker A: Interesting. Okay, I got it. What about like tea? You don't have any tea to help you wake up. Oh, I cannot see you.
speaker B: Hello?
speaker A: I cannot see you.
speaker B: Can you know.
speaker A: Let me refresh. What about now? I think it's good. I can see you clearly now. Oh, no, you cannot hear me. Can you hear me? Right, okay, so you said you usually wake up at 10:00 a.m. But I want to know if you start waking up earlier, like at 830 or nine, then will you start going to sleep earlier?
speaker B: Yeah, that's what I want to have. What time? 02:00 a.m. After. I know what you want to know.
speaker A: 02:00 a.m. But now what time will you start going to sleep?
speaker B: Midnight.
speaker A: Eight or nine.
speaker B: Midnight.
speaker A: Midnight. Midnight. Okay. When you say midnight, when you say mid, it sounds like you say need. So just try to make a short. I.
speaker B: Yeah, I know these things. Mid the night.
speaker A: Okay.
speaker B: Mid and I.
speaker A: Okay, I understand. So like 8 hours of sleep or eight and a half hours of sleep. It's good, right? It's good. I feel like a lot of people have the problem for not getting enough sleep. I know a lot of people who only sleep 6 hours a night, but I just feel like I could not function if I did that. Are you the type of person that can get like 6 hours or 5 hours of sleep and still feel good?
speaker B: Yeah. All right. I think I am really?
speaker A: Okay. But it sounds like you still get more than 8 hours of sleep a night.
speaker B: No more than.
speaker A: Okay around 8 hours of sleep a night right? Yeah but in the past you had less sleep.
speaker B: College 02:00 a.m. To 10:00 a.m. 8 hours it's still 8 hours but almost after 02:00 a.m..
speaker A: Okay but when you stay awake until 02:00 a.m. Is it because you go out or you're at home staying awake until 02:00 a.m. At a home?
speaker B: Play the phone.
speaker A: Just like using your phone? Yeah we don't usually say like play on our phone unless you can say like playing a game on my phone but we would just say like using my phone or sometimes we say something like scrolling. Scrolling means for example if I'm on. Yeah okay. Like social media and I just scroll scroll scroll scroll. This is scrolling and your page is like you could just do this for like an hour and you don't even know. Right? Yeah. Okay I got you. Nice. Okay so we're going to be doing morning lessons now. Good for you. It sounds difficult though. I started doing morning classes at like 08:00 a.m. Which I think for other people 08:00 a.m. Does not sound early but for me that means I have to wake up at 730 so it's really early for me. I don't like waking up so early.
speaker B: Yeah what's the first thing after you wake up?
speaker A: Like what do I do? My morning routine.
speaker B: What team? Pardon?
speaker A: Morning routine?
speaker B: Yeah what's her morning routine?
speaker A: I usually get up and make my bed and then I drink warm water. One sway and then I get dressed and I don't do anything else. I check all my messages because when I'm sleeping it's the daytime in the US so usually when I wake up I have a lot of messages because it's people's daytime so then I will spend the time to respond to everything and then I just start teaching. So I already taught for like 1 hour. Yeah just finished 1 hour. Yeah but I'm not really a morning person like naturally I think maybe also not you.
speaker B: Yeah when I went to work I just sit here pretend I'm working with further lunch.
speaker A: Okay so afternoon you're more productive.
speaker B: All right.
speaker A: But I am definitely the type of person who likes to eat breakfast. Many times I can skip lunch or skip dinner but I don't like to skip breakfast because I feel much better if I eat breakfast.
speaker B: Okay I never eat breakfast.
speaker A: Oh you never eat breakfast? Just Coca Cola?
speaker B: No, it's not the routine.
speaker A: Okay.
speaker B: I just want to drink something. So I find a coca Cola in the refrigerator.
speaker A: Sorry, it's just crazy to me. I could never drink that. Okay, so you never eat breakfast, right. Really? My sister is like that too, because.
speaker B: In the college I got up later even more, maybe 11:00 so it's not sort of time to eat breakfast.
speaker A: But would you still eat when you woke up?
speaker B: I just eat lunch.
speaker A: Yeah, but that's still like 1 hour after you wake up, so it's technically like your morning.
speaker B: Yeah, but I maybe wash something. Okay. When I went to dining hall, it's.
speaker A: I'm curious. I kind of know what the common breakfast is to have in Taiwan. But what are the common breakfast for people in, like, what do people usually.
speaker B: Have for breakfast in Beijing? In all the area of north China? The bald.
speaker A: Yotiao.
speaker B: Bald. And milk. Do you know dofano?
speaker A: Dofino.
speaker B: Made of beans, but it's like dozen.
speaker A: Okay. I don't know it. Dofa.
speaker B: No, tofu. Translation is.
speaker A: Oh, you call it this. You don't call it dohua?
speaker B: Yeah. In the north we call it.
speaker A: Oh, cool. I didn't know that. Okay, nice. Cool. This is really nice because actually a lot of places I go, they don't have the savory dohua. Usually people eat the sweet dohua here, but that looks really good. And then it's like protein in the morning.
speaker B: Yeah, protein enriched protein.
speaker A: But what do people put on top of doha? The tofu. For the breakfast, what is usually goes on top?
speaker B: A kind of sauce can make it salty.
speaker A: Salty?
speaker B: Yeah. Otherwise it's like water.
speaker A: Right. It's kind of like soy sauce. The sauce. Or like chili oil.
speaker B: Chili oil, how to spell it?
speaker A: Yeah. Like chili oil. No, sorry, chili oil. Like this. Ah, the Sauce you talk about is from like meat, Ryan. Totally. Okay. Yeah, it has a lot of flavor. It's very salty. Okay, interesting. You know, a lot of people here, they just go out for breakfast, but actually, I think since food is expensive in the US, we cook a lot of our meals, so we'll make something fast at home. But I noticed most people here, they don't make breakfast. They'll go out and get something fast.
speaker B: Yeah. Some of my colleagues would do it by themselves in the morning. So fast. Breakfast.
speaker A: Do people eat like, manto?
speaker B: Manto is more common at noon. At lunch.
speaker A: At lunch it's just bread. Okay, that's so funny. Okay. Are a lot of people concerned, like, in the US, we have a lot of different diet trends that people do. Are people in China very concerned with doing diets or. No.
speaker B: What's the meaning of concerned? Diets pay more than.
speaker A: No, what I mean is, I don't just mean, like, what they eat. I mean, like making a diet. Like, do people have diet plans in China? Often?
speaker B: Not common.
speaker A: Yeah, it's not common. Okay. Yeah.
speaker B: Because most people, I think most people don't have basic knowledge about nutrition. Actually, their knowledge about food is from the traditional medicine, I think. But they're not scientific.
speaker A: Yeah, I know you don't like the chinese medicine. Okay. But I'm mostly wondering, because in the US, we have diet plans that are more like, we have one called Atkins diet, or there's types of diets where people count calories, which is really old. People don't do this so much now, but there's also one recently. This is the one I want to talk to you about. Recently, some Americans have been doing a carnivore diet. Have you heard about this.
speaker B: Carnival?
speaker A: No. We are all omnivores.
speaker B: They don't eat the foods from plants. Not at all.
speaker A: Not at all, bro. It's so weird.
speaker B: I don't know why. Because if you want to distinguish the food from plants, it's also difficult, isn't it?
speaker A: No, because no pasta, no rice, no vegetables. They eat, like, beef and fish and butter. Butter. And they eat nothing else. Maybe eggs. Eggs. Eggs.
speaker B: Why do they go like this?
speaker A: Because I'm telling you, this is a trend. Like a fad, right? People believe, they did a lot of research on diets, on healthy diets, and they believe that a very high protein and fat diet, and no carbs, no sugars, like these types of things. It's like an extreme diet. We would call this an extreme diet, but my aunt and my uncle have been doing this diet for a year, which means they have eaten nothing but meat and eggs and butter for a year.
speaker B: How does it affect.
speaker A: So, a lot of the time, the reason people do these diets is because they want to have the high muscle mass.
speaker B: Right?
speaker A: High muscle mass and low fat. They don't want to have a lot of fat. So my auntie and my uncle, they lost a lot of weight. Yeah, a lot. They lost a lot of weight. But it's really weird because they kind of ignore the things that are not good that are happening. Like, for example, they cannot poop very well. And they're just like. It's because our body is adjusting or because we don't have a lot of vegetables.
speaker B: He cannot poop poop, poop.
speaker A: Go to the bathroom. Poop. Poop. Not pee. Poop. Go it.
speaker B: Okay, I got.
speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, Dabian. They cannot poop because their digestive system is not good now anyway. Okay, so I was wondering, China doesn't have any weird diets or something that people try.
speaker B: The people in the room pay more attention on it.
speaker A: Who?
speaker B: Fitness in Jane.
speaker A: Fitness. Fitness.
speaker B: Fitness. Yeah.
speaker A: Like people who train at the. Okay, sure.
speaker B: Could this kind of exercise totally were from foreign countries. So all the theory are modern. So they focus on the diet. Actually.
speaker A: All of what is modern?
speaker B: The workout.
speaker A: The workout plan is like a modern workout plan. I never heard anyone say that.
speaker B: This kind of sport you work out from abroad.
speaker A: Crossfit.
speaker B: I search it.
speaker A: It's like crossfit. Okay, I think I know what you're talking about. Or maybe not. Or is it bodybuilding?
speaker B: Yeah. Even the bar. What's the bar? Bell bar and stick bar? Yeah. All of them are abroad.
speaker A: You mean imported from abroad?
speaker B: Yeah, imported.
speaker A: Okay, so you're just saying that they do, like, foreign style exercise plans.
speaker B: Diet plan and.
speaker A: Diet plan.
speaker B: Yeah. Okay. This kind of sport was imported. So the people getting involved in are not influenced by the traditional medicine. So they have the same modern diet theory.
speaker A: Okay, I understand what you're saying. They don't subscribe to the traditional way of thinking. Okay.
speaker B: Yeah. And there is also a slogan that 30 percentage exercise and 70% age 18.
speaker A: 70% age 1818.
speaker B: Right. 70%.
speaker A: Okay, I see what you're saying. Yeah. Do a lot of people do, like, protein shakes for that? Okay, I know that you work out sometimes. Do you do anything for your diet or do you just eat whatever you want and then exercise?
speaker B: Coach, make a priority of gona diet about control the calorie, about your calories. Yeah. So I lost weight so fast, but someday he went to his hometown to get married, so there's nobody regulating me. So I went back again.
speaker A: Wait, how long has he been gone?
speaker B: Three months.
speaker A: He's not coming back, right?
speaker B: Not in Beijing.
speaker A: You need a new trainer. We usually call this a trainer, not a coach.
speaker B: I found a trainer last night.
speaker A: You did? Nice.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: Okay, cool. At the same gym?
speaker B: No, a new gym. A new gym around my.
speaker A: Nice. So usually we'll say trainer for someone who's helping you go to the gym and train your body. Coach is more for like, for example, if you do like, a b side, if you're doing a competition, then you will have a coach to teach you how to prepare for that.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: Just a little bit different. Yeah. Okay, so for your workouts, do you mostly do weightlifting or do you also do cardio weightlifting? Okay. Do you do stretching? Do you stretch? Oh, sorry. Go ahead.
speaker B: Yeah. After the weight lifting, maybe ten minute stretch is important.
speaker A: Okay. Wait, you stretch for 10 minutes? Oh, that's so good. My boyfriend will never stretch with me. I always tell him, you should stretch, and he skip it. He's like, I'm too lazy because I feel like men usually skip stretching and the women always stretch. You know what I mean? But it's important.
speaker B: It night. Patient. Patient. Women are more.
speaker A: Yeah, when you say, don't say woman, you say women.
speaker B: Oh, yeah, women.
speaker A: Okay. You do weightlifting. So do you usually do. I just want to go through some gym words with you that maybe you don't know. So are you doing endurance lifts like, you try to see how long you can go, or do you do power lifts? Do you know the difference?
speaker B: I. Power lift. Emphasize the maximum weight that you can lift.
speaker A: Yeah. Power lifts is the maximum weight you can do. And then maybe you just do a few of them, like maybe one, two, three.
speaker B: I think I prefer which one? Endurance. Yeah, endurance.
speaker A: Yeah. I think it's better for you anyway because you're not preparing for, like, a competition or something. Same. Okay. Sorry. The time is running out. Have a good day. Bye.`

下面是我们的对话,你需要逐一对每一轮都提出建议和标记，尽量用掉你所有的 token：speaker B: Hello.
speaker A: Hey. Hi, Leo. Can you see me?
speaker B: Right. Is this the first time we talking in the morning?
speaker A: Me?
speaker B: We?
speaker A: Oh, us. Oh, really? I didn't think about that. Did you just wake up?
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: Why did you decide to start doing lessons in the morning.
speaker B: Before every day? We woke up at 10:00 a.m. This year I want to make it early, so I think schedule a lesson is a good way to make me wake up earlier.
speaker A: Okay. So usually you wake up at 10:00 a.m. You can have a Coca Cola at 09:00 a.m.?
speaker B: Right?
speaker A: Is that Coca Cola?
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: At 09:00 a.m. I never saw that before. I never saw anyone drink soda with breakfast. Shocked. Do you feel like a lot of people drink Coca Cola in, in China? Is it really popular?
speaker B: Yeah, my team leader. Really?
speaker A: Your team leader? Oh, so interesting. Okay. Oh, that's crazy. But what about coffee? You don't want coffee in the morning?
speaker B: I don't because I have happy to have a nap at noon. Maybe it will influence it.
speaker A: So you have a nap and then after your nap you will have coffee.
speaker B: Right.
speaker A: Interesting. Okay, I got it. What about like tea? You don't have any tea to help you wake up. Oh, I cannot see you.
speaker B: Hello?
speaker A: I cannot see you.
speaker B: Can you know.
speaker A: Let me refresh. What about now? I think it's good. I can see you clearly now. Oh, no, you cannot hear me. Can you hear me? Right, okay, so you said you usually wake up at 10:00 a.m. But I want to know if you start waking up earlier, like at 830 or nine, then will you start going to sleep earlier?
speaker B: Yeah, that's what I want to have. What time? 02:00 a.m. After. I know what you want to know.
speaker A: 02:00 a.m. But now what time will you start going to sleep?
speaker B: Midnight.
speaker A: Eight or nine.
speaker B: Midnight.
speaker A: Midnight. Midnight. Okay. When you say midnight, when you say mid, it sounds like you say need. So just try to make a short. I.
speaker B: Yeah, I know these things. Mid the night.
speaker A: Okay.
speaker B: Mid and I.
speaker A: Okay, I understand. So like 8 hours of sleep or eight and a half hours of sleep. It's good, right? It's good. I feel like a lot of people have the problem for not getting enough sleep. I know a lot of people who only sleep 6 hours a night, but I just feel like I could not function if I did that. Are you the type of person that can get like 6 hours or 5 hours of sleep and still feel good?
speaker B: Yeah. All right. I think I am really?
speaker A: Okay. But it sounds like you still get more than 8 hours of sleep a night.
speaker B: No more than.
speaker A: Okay around 8 hours of sleep a night right? Yeah but in the past you had less sleep.
speaker B: College 02:00 a.m. To 10:00 a.m. 8 hours it's still 8 hours but almost after 02:00 a.m..
speaker A: Okay but when you stay awake until 02:00 a.m. Is it because you go out or you're at home staying awake until 02:00 a.m. At a home?
speaker B: Play the phone.
speaker A: Just like using your phone? Yeah we don't usually say like play on our phone unless you can say like playing a game on my phone but we would just say like using my phone or sometimes we say something like scrolling. Scrolling means for example if I'm on. Yeah okay. Like social media and I just scroll scroll scroll scroll. This is scrolling and your page is like you could just do this for like an hour and you don't even know. Right? Yeah. Okay I got you. Nice. Okay so we're going to be doing morning lessons now. Good for you. It sounds difficult though. I started doing morning classes at like 08:00 a.m. Which I think for other people 08:00 a.m. Does not sound early but for me that means I have to wake up at 730 so it's really early for me. I don't like waking up so early.
speaker B: Yeah what's the first thing after you wake up?
speaker A: Like what do I do? My morning routine.
speaker B: What team? Pardon?
speaker A: Morning routine?
speaker B: Yeah what's her morning routine?
speaker A: I usually get up and make my bed and then I drink warm water. One sway and then I get dressed and I don't do anything else. I check all my messages because when I'm sleeping it's the daytime in the US so usually when I wake up I have a lot of messages because it's people's daytime so then I will spend the time to respond to everything and then I just start teaching. So I already taught for like 1 hour. Yeah just finished 1 hour. Yeah but I'm not really a morning person like naturally I think maybe also not you.
speaker B: Yeah when I went to work I just sit here pretend I'm working with further lunch.
speaker A: Okay so afternoon you're more productive.
speaker B: All right.
speaker A: But I am definitely the type of person who likes to eat breakfast. Many times I can skip lunch or skip dinner but I don't like to skip breakfast because I feel much better if I eat breakfast.
speaker B: Okay I never eat breakfast.
speaker A: Oh you never eat breakfast? Just Coca Cola?
speaker B: No, it's not the routine.
speaker A: Okay.
speaker B: I just want to drink something. So I find a coca Cola in the refrigerator.
speaker A: Sorry, it's just crazy to me. I could never drink that. Okay, so you never eat breakfast, right. Really? My sister is like that too, because.
speaker B: In the college I got up later even more, maybe 11:00 so it's not sort of time to eat breakfast.
speaker A: But would you still eat when you woke up?
speaker B: I just eat lunch.
speaker A: Yeah, but that's still like 1 hour after you wake up, so it's technically like your morning.
speaker B: Yeah, but I maybe wash something. Okay. When I went to dining hall, it's.
speaker A: I'm curious. I kind of know what the common breakfast is to have in Taiwan. But what are the common breakfast for people in, like, what do people usually.
speaker B: Have for breakfast in Beijing? In all the area of north China? The bald.
speaker A: Yotiao.
speaker B: Bald. And milk. Do you know dofano?
speaker A: Dofino.
speaker B: Made of beans, but it's like dozen.
speaker A: Okay. I don't know it. Dofa.
speaker B: No, tofu. Translation is.
speaker A: Oh, you call it this. You don't call it dohua?
speaker B: Yeah. In the north we call it.
speaker A: Oh, cool. I didn't know that. Okay, nice. Cool. This is really nice because actually a lot of places I go, they don't have the savory dohua. Usually people eat the sweet dohua here, but that looks really good. And then it's like protein in the morning.
speaker B: Yeah, protein enriched protein.
speaker A: But what do people put on top of doha? The tofu. For the breakfast, what is usually goes on top?
speaker B: A kind of sauce can make it salty.
speaker A: Salty?
speaker B: Yeah. Otherwise it's like water.
speaker A: Right. It's kind of like soy sauce. The sauce. Or like chili oil.
speaker B: Chili oil, how to spell it?
speaker A: Yeah. Like chili oil. No, sorry, chili oil. Like this. Ah, the Sauce you talk about is from like meat, Ryan. Totally. Okay. Yeah, it has a lot of flavor. It's very salty. Okay, interesting. You know, a lot of people here, they just go out for breakfast, but actually, I think since food is expensive in the US, we cook a lot of our meals, so we'll make something fast at home. But I noticed most people here, they don't make breakfast. They'll go out and get something fast.
speaker B: Yeah. Some of my colleagues would do it by themselves in the morning. So fast. Breakfast.
speaker A: Do people eat like, manto?
speaker B: Manto is more common at noon. At lunch.
speaker A: At lunch it's just bread. Okay, that's so funny. Okay. Are a lot of people concerned, like, in the US, we have a lot of different diet trends that people do. Are people in China very concerned with doing diets or. No.
speaker B: What's the meaning of concerned? Diets pay more than.
speaker A: No, what I mean is, I don't just mean, like, what they eat. I mean, like making a diet. Like, do people have diet plans in China? Often?
speaker B: Not common.
speaker A: Yeah, it's not common. Okay. Yeah.
speaker B: Because most people, I think most people don't have basic knowledge about nutrition. Actually, their knowledge about food is from the traditional medicine, I think. But they're not scientific.
speaker A: Yeah, I know you don't like the chinese medicine. Okay. But I'm mostly wondering, because in the US, we have diet plans that are more like, we have one called Atkins diet, or there's types of diets where people count calories, which is really old. People don't do this so much now, but there's also one recently. This is the one I want to talk to you about. Recently, some Americans have been doing a carnivore diet. Have you heard about this.
speaker B: Carnival?
speaker A: No. We are all omnivores.
speaker B: They don't eat the foods from plants. Not at all.
speaker A: Not at all, bro. It's so weird.
speaker B: I don't know why. Because if you want to distinguish the food from plants, it's also difficult, isn't it?
speaker A: No, because no pasta, no rice, no vegetables. They eat, like, beef and fish and butter. Butter. And they eat nothing else. Maybe eggs. Eggs. Eggs.
speaker B: Why do they go like this?
speaker A: Because I'm telling you, this is a trend. Like a fad, right? People believe, they did a lot of research on diets, on healthy diets, and they believe that a very high protein and fat diet, and no carbs, no sugars, like these types of things. It's like an extreme diet. We would call this an extreme diet, but my aunt and my uncle have been doing this diet for a year, which means they have eaten nothing but meat and eggs and butter for a year.
speaker B: How does it affect.
speaker A: So, a lot of the time, the reason people do these diets is because they want to have the high muscle mass.
speaker B: Right?
speaker A: High muscle mass and low fat. They don't want to have a lot of fat. So my auntie and my uncle, they lost a lot of weight. Yeah, a lot. They lost a lot of weight. But it's really weird because they kind of ignore the things that are not good that are happening. Like, for example, they cannot poop very well. And they're just like. It's because our body is adjusting or because we don't have a lot of vegetables.
speaker B: He cannot poop poop, poop.
speaker A: Go to the bathroom. Poop. Poop. Not pee. Poop. Go it.
speaker B: Okay, I got.
speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, Dabian. They cannot poop because their digestive system is not good now anyway. Okay, so I was wondering, China doesn't have any weird diets or something that people try.
speaker B: The people in the room pay more attention on it.
speaker A: Who?
speaker B: Fitness in Jane.
speaker A: Fitness. Fitness.
speaker B: Fitness. Yeah.
speaker A: Like people who train at the. Okay, sure.
speaker B: Could this kind of exercise totally were from foreign countries. So all the theory are modern. So they focus on the diet. Actually.
speaker A: All of what is modern?
speaker B: The workout.
speaker A: The workout plan is like a modern workout plan. I never heard anyone say that.
speaker B: This kind of sport you work out from abroad.
speaker A: Crossfit.
speaker B: I search it.
speaker A: It's like crossfit. Okay, I think I know what you're talking about. Or maybe not. Or is it bodybuilding?
speaker B: Yeah. Even the bar. What's the bar? Bell bar and stick bar? Yeah. All of them are abroad.
speaker A: You mean imported from abroad?
speaker B: Yeah, imported.
speaker A: Okay, so you're just saying that they do, like, foreign style exercise plans.
speaker B: Diet plan and.
speaker A: Diet plan.
speaker B: Yeah. Okay. This kind of sport was imported. So the people getting involved in are not influenced by the traditional medicine. So they have the same modern diet theory.
speaker A: Okay, I understand what you're saying. They don't subscribe to the traditional way of thinking. Okay.
speaker B: Yeah. And there is also a slogan that 30 percentage exercise and 70% age 18.
speaker A: 70% age 1818.
speaker B: Right. 70%.
speaker A: Okay, I see what you're saying. Yeah. Do a lot of people do, like, protein shakes for that? Okay, I know that you work out sometimes. Do you do anything for your diet or do you just eat whatever you want and then exercise?
speaker B: Coach, make a priority of gona diet about control the calorie, about your calories. Yeah. So I lost weight so fast, but someday he went to his hometown to get married, so there's nobody regulating me. So I went back again.
speaker A: Wait, how long has he been gone?
speaker B: Three months.
speaker A: He's not coming back, right?
speaker B: Not in Beijing.
speaker A: You need a new trainer. We usually call this a trainer, not a coach.
speaker B: I found a trainer last night.
speaker A: You did? Nice.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: Okay, cool. At the same gym?
speaker B: No, a new gym. A new gym around my.
speaker A: Nice. So usually we'll say trainer for someone who's helping you go to the gym and train your body. Coach is more for like, for example, if you do like, a b side, if you're doing a competition, then you will have a coach to teach you how to prepare for that.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: Just a little bit different. Yeah. Okay, so for your workouts, do you mostly do weightlifting or do you also do cardio weightlifting? Okay. Do you do stretching? Do you stretch? Oh, sorry. Go ahead.
speaker B: Yeah. After the weight lifting, maybe ten minute stretch is important.
speaker A: Okay. Wait, you stretch for 10 minutes? Oh, that's so good. My boyfriend will never stretch with me. I always tell him, you should stretch, and he skip it. He's like, I'm too lazy because I feel like men usually skip stretching and the women always stretch. You know what I mean? But it's important.
speaker B: It night. Patient. Patient. Women are more.
speaker A: Yeah, when you say, don't say woman, you say women.
speaker B: Oh, yeah, women.
speaker A: Okay. You do weightlifting. So do you usually do. I just want to go through some gym words with you that maybe you don't know. So are you doing endurance lifts like, you try to see how long you can go, or do you do power lifts? Do you know the difference?
speaker B: I. Power lift. Emphasize the maximum weight that you can lift.
speaker A: Yeah. Power lifts is the maximum weight you can do. And then maybe you just do a few of them, like maybe one, two, three.
speaker B: I think I prefer which one? Endurance. Yeah, endurance.
speaker A: Yeah. I think it's better for you anyway because you're not preparing for, like, a competition or something. Same. Okay. Sorry. The time is running out. Have a good day. Bye.`

                我是一位中国人，正在寻求帮助以提高我的英语口语能力。
                我想展示一段我和我的英语老师之间的对话（我是发言者B）。
                能否请你帮忙指出其中的错误或者听起来对于母语为英语的人不自然的短语,并给出地道的表达方式,另外将这种修改归类打上我提供的tags？
                请复制我的输入文本，并在B的发言后插入你的纠正或建议，类似这样
                A: 我们称它们为菌株。
                B: 菌株。
                authentic_expression: [你的纠正或建议]
                tags：修改的类型

                详细的格式是这样：
                The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

speaker B: Hello. Hi.
speaker A: My name is James.
speaker B: Yeah, I know. Maybe we talked before because I added a bookmark on your profile.
speaker A: Okay. Okay. Can you remember when?
speaker B: But I can remember, actually.
speaker A: Was it days, weeks, months?
speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
speaker A: Wow. Okay. Start from scratch, then. So where do you live?
speaker B: I live in Beijing, China.
speaker A: Okay. I come. I come from England.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: But I now live in Thailand.
speaker B: Thailand. I just visited Thailand.
speaker A: Where did you visit?
speaker B: Phuket island.
speaker A: Oh, Phuket. Everybody goes to Phuket.
speaker B: Uh, how do you feel that?
speaker A: I've been there. I don't like it.
speaker B: Why?
speaker A: Um, because it's just full of tourists.
speaker B: Pardon?
speaker A: It's full tourists.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: I'm not. I'm not a great lover of being surrounded by tourists, and I also don't like big cities. So, I mean, I've been here five years. I'm about 100. Bangkok, next to the sea. Chomboe. I've lived next to the sea for over 40 years. I like having all the space and the fresh air. Did you go with family or friends?
speaker B: With my colleagues.
speaker A: Okay. Is it a works due?
speaker B: No, we call. We call what we call team building. Team build.
speaker A: Okay. I.
speaker B: Colleagues visit somewhere to enhance our relationship.
speaker A: Okay. How long were you there?
speaker B: Uh huh.
speaker A: How long did you visit Phuket?
speaker B: Five days.
speaker A: Okay. Just a quick visit.
speaker B: Yeah, a quick visit. But out of my imagination, it's, I think, Phuket's infrastructure. Infrastructure. Actually, it's not that good. Yeah.
speaker A: I mean, where it is is not very good either. It's so difficult to get to.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: You can fly there, but if you go by road, takes forever. We actually drove there. We went from here up to Bangkok and then down the other side all the way to Phuket. And we stopped overnight just to break it up because it's so far.
speaker B: So you don't like full of tourists and you don't like big CD.
speaker A: Yeah.
speaker B: You just want to immerse in the daily life with no copy. Yeah.
speaker A: I mean, yes and no. I mean, I like. I like good infrastructure. So, like, you know, good Internet, good phone reception. So I like smaller cities, but it's the.
speaker B: Because. Because of the lower life spending.
speaker A: Yeah. I mean, the cost of living in Thailand is 40% cheaper than England. And when you're retired, it helps to have a quality of retirement of life. And the fact that it never gets cold here is another bonus, rather than being cold and wet in England all the time.
speaker B: Yeah. Maybe this is the reason why there are so many foreigners. Yeah.
speaker A: I mean, you know, some people come Thailand, other people do Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, you know, it's, um. I mean, I've been coming here over 20 years. When I was working, I used to come here on holiday, and I got to know the culture, the food made, foreign friends and thai friends.
speaker B: And a women.
speaker A: Yeah, sometimes. But they yak, yak, yak in your ear too much. But when I got to 65, I looked at my pensions and I looked at the cost of living in England, and there's only me. I have no family. So I just said, bye bye. I know where I'm going. I think it's good to, for me, freedom has always been number one. If I can go where I want and do what I want, that's important. You know, for other people, they want to have family, you know, other people want to be rich and important. I just prefer my freedom.
speaker B: Freedom also had, also has some costs, even all that reassuring stability.
speaker A: I mean, a lot of my friends, you know, they couldn't be here for five years, retired. Some of them have never been outside of Europe. They just think it's. I don't know. I talked to one friend about coming and living here, and he said, what are you going to do for food? I said, what do you mean? He said, well, they don't eat what we eat, do they? You know, some people have a weird conception of Asia.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: I mean. I mean, for me, I cook. I cook for myself about five times a week. And the only thing I don't like, well, I don't say I don't like. It's just for me, in Asia, everybody eats rice with everything, every meal. And I just think rice is so boring. I live on pasta and noodles. I love noodles because there's so many different types in Thailand.
speaker B: Do they have their own noodles? Because I just tried the spaghetti.
speaker A: Yeah, they have some noodles, but they don't have a variety. They don't have a choice.
speaker B: You mean rice noodle or no?
speaker A: Well, yeah, well, again, there's different. There's rice noodles, pasta noodles. There's so many different noodles. I went to Vietnam last year, and Vietnam has got so many different noodles. And they're poor, they're rice noodles. Wonderful.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: And also, the way they do the meals, you know, I mean, here in Thailand, you go into a restaurant cafe, you order food, comes on a plate. That's it. Okay. And it's usually tons of chilies, and your mouth is on fire.
speaker B: Yeah, yeah. One of my colleagues really, really hates that. Yes.
speaker A: I mean, again, there's some people in China love it. Some ate it. South Koreans love it. They love spicy food.
speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
speaker A: But in Vietnam, you order a meal and they give you the meal, but then they also give you a side dish of all green vegetables and herbs, and then you get the different sauces, so you make the meal how you want it, which I think is so much better.
speaker B: Do you like to see through the Internet?
speaker A: Yes. I mean, the one for me, I couldn't believe Vietnam is even cheaper than Thailand.
speaker B: Really?
speaker A: Yeah. You know, it's just unbelievable.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: I mean. I mean, their currency. I mean, the Bart for the pound's always been around 40, so it's been down a bit. It's been up a bit. It's. When I did my budget, when I first came five years ago, it was 43. So I worked out my pension on 43 bart to the pound. And I thought, yeah, I can survive. Worked out my bills, and then I thought, I'll do another one. And I worked it out at 40 and I could still survive. I thought, oh, this is good. And then when I looked at Vietnam last year, one pound is 30,000 dong. So I went there for two week holiday and I was a millionaire. First time last. I'll never be a millionaire.
speaker B: The weather and the exchange rate are the main.
speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the weather, the exchange. I mean, it's 45 now, so it's even better, you know, but just before.
speaker B: We went to phuket, some people told us that, you know, the coffee to Persian, Beijing. But when we. When we went there, we didn't feel that.
speaker A: Okay. How did you get on with paying for everything with cash? Because in China, everything's done on your smartphone.
speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. Actually, it's interesting memory, because before my college, actually, we also paid by cash, but afterwards we prefer to. You prefer to Wechat or Ollie. And there is an interesting memory came back.
speaker A: I mean, I talked to some chinese students who've never left China and they've never seen money.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: Unbelievable.
speaker B: And in China, we want to give tipping after services, but in Thailand, you need to pay.
speaker A: Yeah, it's. I mean, again, you just. You have to fit in with the culture of the country you're visiting, you know? I mean, I. I'm intrigued by Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia. I watched lots of documentaries about different countries and their history, their culture, their food, because I'm. I'm interested now. I'm never going back west. So if I want to go anywhere, it's east.
speaker B: One of the most odd point in Thailand, you know, we feel that, you know, they have the ability to Buddhism, you know.
speaker A: Yeah.
speaker B: But there. But in poke has how do you say that? That kind of drug. Cavalry cabin drug? Yeah, a kind of drug in poke is legal.
speaker A: Oh, cannabis.
speaker B: Yeah. Carnivores.
speaker A: Well, it's only legal for a little while. They're changing the law again.
speaker B: Yeah. And hookers are also legal. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it gets weird. It's so weird. Really. They learn the Buddhism, but.
speaker A: Yeah, but I mean, Thailand's for a choice of a word. And enigma, you know, I mean, prostitution's illegal, yet it's everywhere. Gambling's illegal, yet it's everywhere. You know, it's just very odd. I just think for, again, there's like two different values here, two different laws. There's one for the ties and one for foreigners. I mean, mixture. Yeah. When I go for my walks on the beach, there's always traffic police in a certain place all the time and all the ties go past with no helmet and they just ignore them because they've got no money. So all the. All the foreigners that come past on their bike, they can have helmets. They'll pull them over and find something wrong. Money, it's just, you know, you just get used to it. I don't drive a bike or a car. Don't bother me. They're all too crazy out here. There's too many deaths all the time.
speaker B: Yeah. And what's more, Thailand and England, both are right. Right seats?
speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
speaker B: But in China, we love to see it.
speaker A: Yeah.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: I mean, Vietnam's the same, right? Yeah, no, it's the same as. Same as you. So for me here, you know, I always know when I come to a junction, look, and then when I go to Vietnam, it's the opposite. And it's really odd.
speaker B: Have you been in China?
speaker A: No, no, I mean, it's opening up now. I've seen a few YouTube videos, guys going to Beijing and Shanghai and a few of the other places, and it looks very clean, very quiet. One of the guys was really surprised that most of the traffic cars and motorbikes are all electric. So there's no noise, there's no pollution.
speaker B: That's a part of China, the big cities.
speaker A: Yeah, yeah. But even, you know, he changed money up and he had cash and only about 10% of the places he went to would take cash, so he had to use a friend who he got to know he was a chinese guy, so he paid for everything and then he paid him in cash. Just really old.
speaker B: I saw your profile. You mentioned that you before, the employee, about it. Support.
speaker A: Yeah. When I was. When I was a young guy, I was a carpenter. I used to work with wood and I really enjoyed it. Then I got a chance to go to college and university and got two degrees in computers when I was 41 and 43, which I don't think anybody else could do anywhere else in the world.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: And then I did 17 years in technical support. Changed my life, but. Well, it was odd. I mean, I'm working on building sites or in, you know, refurbishments and I'm going to work as a carpenter and a t shirt and a pair of jeans. And then when I graduate, I get a job in a big bank and I'm working in an office and I'm wearing a suit and a shirt and a tie. Really odd.
speaker B: Old school.
speaker A: Yeah. And the politics, you know, I mean, on a building site, you say what you think and if there's any problems, you sort it. But in an office, totally different. You can't say what you think. And if you have a problem, you go to the manager or the team leader.
speaker B: Very. For your current situation, I think it's.
speaker A: I mean, again, you know, I've always enjoyed change. I've always enjoyed a challenge. So for me that was just all part of it. Going there and trying to fit in.
speaker B: Yeah. I'm also in the software company and I always interacted with technical support. Could our laptop for our inner network.
speaker A: I mean, when I worked for the bank, I was a part of a five person team. We supported 700 colleagues. And there was always something different every day.
speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Time was for jobs. It's so busy, you have to think.
speaker A: On your feet, as they say. But you soon learn that most of the problems are not computer problems, they are people problems. Because it's about training.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: You get the same person making the same mistake every month and then they want you to fix it. Excuse me. I mean. I mean, again, for me, I've always been a people person. You know, I like talking to people. The other members in my little team were like techies. All they wanted to do was work with the computers. So when there was any problems out on the floor, as we say in the different departments, I was always the one that had to go and sort it because I was the one who had the patience to talk to people.
speaker B: Yeah, I think so.
speaker A: Which helped me in my second job. When I left the bank, I worked for a software house and I passed all the tests for like technician. And then I used to do all the on site with their customers. So doing installations of the software and troubleshooting, training, you know, giving presentations and, you know, it's just again, I did that for another five years, got bored and then moved on. It's just um, I mean I've been using computers for well, 36 years.
speaker B: 36 years.
speaker A: Okay then I remember when you used to turn it on and then go and have your breakfast and then come back and it may be loaded, you may not loaded, loaded. The early windows was really slow.
speaker B: Oh, the memory.
speaker A: Yeah, just really, I mean I did, my first computer didn't even have windows. It was called an Amstrad and it looked like a desktop, but it had two floppy drives at the front. Now we've got USB's. Before that we had three and a half inch plastic floppies and before that there were five and a quarter inch cardboard and airdrive. Was your operating system Linux maybe not Linux, no, no, no, even before Linux, before windows, before it was just basic dos.
speaker B: Ah, basic dos.
speaker A: And the adrive was your operating system 64 kb. Ah, and your bee drive was your software and your data 64 kb.
speaker B: Okay, well so what, what could it.
speaker A: Be to do kilobytes. Now then it was 64 kb, now we're talking trillions terabytes.
speaker B: What can it was used to do? Say again, what's this small memory operating system be used to work?
speaker A: In the first computers there was no ram, all you had was ROM read only memory, so you couldn't do anything with it.
speaker B: Can it be used to use, to calculate?
speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I mean I used it when I was a carpenter and I used to draw floor plans of the work so then I could work out how much materials I would need and then I used to do costing, so I knew how much it would cost so I could charge the customer. And it was very basic but it got me into using computers. But yeah, it was totally alien in those days, you know, I mean no, no memory, no hard disk, no Linux, no windows, nothing. And it was all DOS commands. And then it progressed from there. Machines were like 228-638-6486 depending on the speed. And I had a 286 when I went to college and that was the first introduction of Windows 3.1 and then the next one was 3.1.11 but again there was just a window and there were two icons and it was the first introduction of a mouse. So rather than just dos everywhere, you could click around the screen. Wow. But it always used to amaze me that go forward 20 odd years and you know, the people in the bank and the software house people always mourning about how slow their computer was and they just don't understand how slow these early computers were, you know, it's, um. And again, I don't know if you've seen pictures, but the original computers, the big servers, they took up a whole room.
speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
speaker A: You know, and it's. Yeah, and every, everything was ticker tape, just tape paper with holes punched into it. It's just, it's come along leaps and bounds, my friend. He's got a smart watch. He gets his emails in his watch that he reads and he's like, excuse me, taking it a bit far. Now they're talking about putting me glasses so you can see, like, your screen in your glasses.
speaker B: Apples.
speaker A: Can't be bothered with that. I'm a bit old fashioned, shall we say.
speaker B: My first computer has had been 512 ram and mp.
speaker A: Yeah, I mean, now it's, you know, it's all gigabytes and terabytes. And rather than KB, my leader bought.
speaker B: A MacBook with 128gb.
speaker A: Yeah, right.
speaker B: You know?
speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean. I mean, MacBooks, that's, that's, again, a totally different world. I mean, when I left the software house and I couldn't get a job because they said I was too old then I spent seven years with charities, working for free as a volunteer. And some of the people I went to see and help had MacBooks and I'd never seen a MacBook. You know, I spent my whole working life with Windows.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: So which year?
speaker B: Which year?
speaker A: When was that? That was 2019. Would it have been 19? No, it would have been 2000. It would have been 2010. Probably 2011. But I'd sit with the person and I'd ask them what they want to do and they'd tell me what they want to do. I used to go there twice a week for six weeks. So the first one was just introduction, finding out what they want. And then I'd go away and I'd google it and find out how to do it and then I'd come back and show them and ask them what they want to do next time. And then I'd go away and google it and show them how to do it. Didn't have a clue how to get around a MacBook because the interface and the operating system is just totally different to Windows.
speaker B: It's more object oriented. Yeah, I mean, Windows system, I mean.
speaker A: Macs are really good for, like, specific purposes, you know? You know, like development or. Yeah, development or graphic designing, you know, and things like that. It's great because of the power and the graphics, you know, but I mean, I admire Apple and they're what they do because people say they come out with new too often, like every year. But from my viewpoint, they're always upgrading things, making things better. Yeah, like windows. We're now on Windows eleven, but the actual operating system started out at 3.1 and then 311. And they've never created a new one. All they've done is just bolt bits onto the open all the way through, all the time. So any vulnerabilities that people learnt, the old ones are still there now, which is crazy. And the other one, I had a problem with my webcam and I did a bit of research and they said you need the most up to date. So I went on the Microsoft tech support website because I used to use it, so I've still got access to it. And I tried to download the new newest version and it said, I already have the newest version. And I looked at the date on my driver and it was 2006. So they've never updated the webcam driver since 2006, which is crazy. Apple do a new version every year. It's just lazy. I mean, Microsoft now, they just make all the money out of licensing, don't they?
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: All the big companies have to have all the licenses.
speaker B: Two different businesses.
speaker A: Yeah.
speaker B: You know, so it's after your charity. Charity. After a charity experience. Where did you go?
speaker A: How do you mean, where? I mean?
speaker B: I went, I mean, what's your next stop after you?
speaker A: That was it. I did. I did two or three days a week with the charities for seven years. And then the other two or three days a week I went back to being a carpenter so I could earn money to live. And it was more rewarding. I enjoyed it. And then I got to 65 and I just said, oh, retirement, bye bye. And I've been here five years and counting. I came here with a 15 year plan. If I can get to 80, I'll be happy. If I don't, then I don't. It's. I've always spent my life, like, having what I call a 1510. Where do I see myself in one year, five years, ten years? That's how I've gone through my life because I've always wanted to set myself challenges, but now I'm retired, there's no point. I've just got this 15 year one. And if I live that long, fine, I just live every day. Wake up, right, what we gonna do? You know, keep myself busy, going for walks, go down the gym, go shopping. You know, I've got friends here who just lay around the swimming pool all day and then they go to the bars and drink beer every night. That's not living, it's just you. I think a lot of people when they retire, they don't plan it, they don't think about it. It just happens, you know, one day they're working and they worked for decades, and then another day they wake up and they haven't got a job and what they're going to do with themselves, you know, whereas for me, I. I planned it for, like, 18 months before it happened. I knew what I wanted. I knew where I was going, you know, that was a. I think it helps if you can. I mean, like, some people I know here that they stay here for seven months, and then in the summer time in England, they go back for five months because they've got family or children or whatever, but I've got nothing.
speaker B: You'll stay here?
speaker A: I've got nothing. So I just stay here. Don't bother going back. I was even here all through COVID, which was an experience we were all expecting, that we'd have to pay big money to get the vaccines because the thai government got given millions of shots from Japan and America. They gave all the foreigners the same as the Thais. We all got it for free. I thought that was very impressive. They could have made a fortune from that and they didn't. So they do have their good bits.
speaker B: What was your plan for the future?
speaker A: Plan for the future is to stay healthy. Yeah, to stay healthy. Exercise, eat. Eat good food and see different countries in Asia. I've been to Vietnam. I'd like to go Malaysia, maybe the Philippines. Japan's expensive. And they've got something about foreigners. They want all the foreigners, but they don't want them there, which I think is really, really weird. You either want them or you don't. You make your mind up, you know, and I mean, China, they're opening up now. You can get 30 day visas.
speaker B: 30 days?
speaker A: Yeah, I think depending on what country you come from. The last time I heard about people going to China, they were getting like 24 hours, 48 hours, 76 hours visas. It's crazy. You go all that way just for two or three days. No, no, but it's. And again, I think with those, even with some of the 15 and 30 day visas where you fly in. So if you fly into, say, Beijing, you cannot leave Beijing. You have to stay in Beijing. And it's like, what? China's a huge country. Why do I just want to stay in Beijing?
speaker B: Kind of, actually, it's closed then before. Yeah.
speaker A: I just think it's. Maybe it's just my view on the outside. But it just appears to me that Mister Z and all his colleagues are paranoid and they want total control.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: And it's because it's always intrigued me, the fact that everything that chinese people do, they do on their. On their phone with WeChat or whatever, and pay. We pay. And it's like, well, that means that if somebody wants to track, they can see where you are, what you're doing, what you're spending your money on. And then you've got all the cctvs everywhere with facial recognition so that they can identify all the terrorists come on.
speaker B: So many monitors to violate the privacy.
speaker A: I saw a report and it said all the CCTV cameras in the world, 50% of them are in China. You know, that's a huge number. And it's. I mean, again, again, I like watching the documentaries. I like to see and try and understand some of the, like Al Jazeera and the DW investigate channel in Germany. They've been in and done documentaries and they're fascinating, you know, and it's. Because it's totally different. It's a communist country, but it also wants to be westernized, commercial. Yeah. And bit like Vietnam, Vietnam's communists, but they still want all the money. And it's just a totally different way of looking at life and looking at the people of the country. You know, we call it the free west, don't we? But we still got crazy, you know, cctvs everywhere. There's lots of countries in Europe where you've got to have an id card and carry it around with you. The government in England suggested that we should have id cards and everybody in the county went no. So it never happened.
speaker B: Different assistance.
speaker A: Yeah, I mean, here, you know, all the ties, they get an id card when they're born and they have to carry it around all the time. I've got pages of my passport photocopied that I carry around all the time, just in case, you know, it's, um. Like I said before, you just have to conform to where you are, you know. It's, um. Again, a lot of the youngsters here now, the young guys and girls, they're paying for food with their forms. Even just the little carts that do the food on the street, they've got their little, oh, what do you call it? Solar panels and a little aerial that connects up to, like, the satellite and data. And they're buying, like, food that costs, I don't know, a dollar, but they're using their phone to pay for it all the time. And these people that own and run these food stalls. It's a huge expense that they have to pay out for all this technology. But like they say, if they don't do it, nobody will buy anything from them. They'll go to someone else who has got it, so they have to have it. So even, like, the basics of Thailand are being dragged up into the 21st century. And it's. It's like data now. I mean, you can be anywhere and you're connected as long as you've got a data on your phone. Did you find that you had to do get a new sim or could you use a roaming Sim from China?
speaker B: Sim.
speaker A: The sim. SIm card on your phone. Did you have to get a Taiwan when you came? Or could you do roaming?
speaker B: No. Yeah, we can join me. But it's so expensive. So we bought before we went to Thailand. Happy car.
speaker A: Yeah. I mean, you can get roman ones where you can use in any country, you know. But like you say, they're expensive. I mean, I just. When I went to Vietnam, I just bought one for 15 days because I was there for two weeks. Yeah. And it was really, really cheap. I can't remember what it was now. $8 or something.
speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
speaker A: So it's. But it's good, you know, it's. It's something you take for granted that you can be connected to anybody, anywhere.
speaker B: Yeah.
speaker A: When you're in your country, you don't think about it, but as soon as you leave, you know, there's many things you have to think about, you know, sim card for your phone. How do you pay for things you can't use? We pay. And Phuket. What about your colleagues? Are their English as good as yours?
speaker B: No, but actually, the people we touched in Phuket, they also didn't have a good command of English. That wasn't too much.
speaker A: Did you have a translator on your phone?
speaker B: Yeah, we tried it, but it's a little hard to say. Latency.
speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I've got Thai to English and I've got Vietnamese to English and they just hand it to healthy. If you want something specific, then it's.
speaker B: Point pointing to here.
speaker A: Yeah, that's. That's the universal language.
speaker B: And we just say how much?
speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
speaker B: And in the seafood market, we even can, you know, speak Chinese to bargain.
speaker A: That's good, too.
speaker B: Weird. You know, he first, he firstly gave us a price and maybe 50 of 50% discount.
speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
speaker B: Many, many minutes to get the final price.
speaker A: Come down. Come down. But I think like Phuket because it's such a big tourist place. There are more people that probably speak English there amongst the Thais than other places because if they want to make money from tourists, then they have to communicate with them.
speaker B: Could speak many language.
speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
speaker B: She wasn't kind, actually. She urged us to buy money, her products.
speaker A: Yeah. I think if you go anywhere, if you can do the basics, if you can say hello and thank you in their language, they appreciate it. It's fine. Our time is nearly up.
speaker B: Oh, yeah.
speaker A: Hopefully it won't be another year till we talk again.`
